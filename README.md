# Objective
A NES emulator written in Java. The program allows users to play classic NES games on their computer. The program emulates the 6052 processor, Picture Processing Unit (PPU), Audio Processing Unit (APU), and other componenets of the NES to provide an authentic gaming experience. Users can load NES ROMs into the emulator, which are then executed by the CPU and displayed on the screen using the PPU. The emulator also includes support for audio playback using the APU, allowing users to experience the sounds and music of their favorite NES games. The program supports keyboard input for controlling the games and can also be used with gamepads.
